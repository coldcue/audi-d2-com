# Fuel Line Leak Repair

:::danger 

The 97-99 A8 is prone to two types of fuel leaks, **one coming from
the high pressure fuel line under the hood**, and the other at the **gas tank
sending unit seal in the trunk**. 

:::

## Fuel line under the hood

:::info 

It is normally noticed during the cold winter months. The fitting leaks
when very cold and fuel leaks out. It creates a smell of fuel in the passenger
compartment. Once the fuel line heats up a small amount (such as after the car
is turned off in the winter and the engine heat causes it to increase in
temperature), it usually seals up. 

::: 

:::caution 

Fuel leaks and lines are
serious business. This procedure is for a repair of the line versus replacement
of the entire fuel line system. The fuel lines (which are all together as a kit)
from the dealer is about $800 for the parts. Then it has to be installed from
the engine compartment back to the fuel tank. This procedure repairs the leak,
costs about $10.00 and takes about an hour.

### Supplies and Tools Required

- 17 mm open ended wrench
- 14 mm open ended wrench
- Cutting tool for fuel line connections
- 5/16" fuel line suitable for fuel injection systems (4 feet will do both
  supply and return line)
- 2 hose clamps per line 

### Procedure

The fuel hose leaks on the high pressure side at one of the fittings. The fuel
hoses are sold as one piece from the dealer, which include the supply, return
and one other hose attached. It is a one piece kit that runs from the engine to
the gas tank.

#### Removal

1. Remove the low pressure fuel line from the fuel regulator. This is required
   to get proper access to the high pressure line.

2. Place a paper towel under the fuel line to capture the fuel that will drip.

3. Relieve the residual fuel pressure in the fuel line by cracking the high
   pressure line fittings. This is accomplished by using the 17 and 14 mm wrenches.

4. Remove the high pressure line

#### Assembly

1. Using a saw or other device, cut the fuel line fitting. Cut almost all the
   way through it and then use a pair of pliers to tear it apart. If you do the
   fender side first, you can then take it to your work bench and remove the
   fuel rail side next in a vice or other device.

2. Cut the new 5/16" fuel hose to length
3. Put a hose clamp on each end, and slide it over the barb fittings. 
4. Secure the hose clamp (make sure it's tight).

5. Reassemble everything and you are done!
