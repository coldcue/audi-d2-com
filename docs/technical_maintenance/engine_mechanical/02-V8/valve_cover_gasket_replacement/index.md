# Valve Cover Gasket Replacement

If your A8 smells oily a few minutes after start up, or if
your garage smells like a Jiffy Lube, then it could be the valve cover gaskets leaking. If
the smoke is coming from under the car, you might also consider the transmission final
drive seal which can leak onto the left hand catalytic converter. To check if it is your
valve cover gaskets, open the hood of your car, start the engine when cold, and let it idle
for a few minutes. If a few whiffs of smoke start appearing around the sides or back of
the engine after things warm up, it’s probably the valve cover gaskets.

:::info Make sure
Make sure you replace both valve cover gaskets at the
same time.
You might want to consider replacing the spark
plugs at the same time. `TODO: MISSING LINK`

## Tools Required

- Screwdrivers
- Metric allen head wrenches
- Metric socket and wrench set
- (2) 17 mm open ended wrenches
- (1) 14 mm open ended wrenches
- Blue paper towels to keep things clean
- Brake cleaner
- “Brush in Can” gasket sealer such as
- Permatex Aviation or Loctite High Tack
- Auto silicone sealer such as Dow
- Permatex or Loctite


## Procedure

### Remove the engine plastic

Pull the side pieces first, then the center piece. Loosen intake hose clamps; remove
hose and set aside. Stuff a paper towel into both the throttle body
on engine and mass air sensor on air cleaner housing.

### Remove the spark plug coils

Each plug has a coil. Each coil is held in place with
(2) 6mm cap screws (10mm hex head).
Remove all 16 cap screws. Gently remove each
coil, pulling straight up, starting at the front of the
motor. Remove the coil wiring from the black plastic
wire trough as you go.
Place the left hand bank coils and wires up on the
firewall at the rear of the engine. Gentle, don’t drop
or bang the coils. Place the right hand coils and wires
off to the right of the valve cover - they are held in a
loose string by connections at the right hand front of
the motor. Remove spark plug plastic troughs (two 6
mm cap screws in each bank). If you choose to replace
the plugs, blow out any grit in the plug wells after
breaking each plug loose.

:::note
Each coil is bolted in place, fuel lines
are above and on the left, engine throttle body is stuffed with rag,
and valve cover breather hose is on the front end of the valve cover.
:::

### Remove Valve Covers

Remove the valve cover breather hose at front of motor. It
simply connects the valve covers together. Just gently push
the hose off each valve cover fitting. You can reuse the
clamps by just leaving them in place.
Push other hoses, etc. out of the way. There will be a
couple of them lapping over the center edge of each valve
cover. Just tuck them in with the injector rails toward the
intake manifold.
Remove the two EFI supply fuel lines. These are
situated at the rear of the RH valve cover. Use two wrenches
on each fitting (17mm & 17mm; 17mm & 14mm).
Doing this will “backup” the stationary fitting, while you
break loose and remove the rotating fitting. Place a paper
towel under the fittings to catch any gas drips - though
there should be little if any.

:::caution Important
Blow off any loose grit or
dirt from around the valve covers. This stuff
tends to accumulate under the engine plastic,
and you don’t want it inside your engine when
the valve covers come off. Use a compressor,
bicycle pump, aerosol brake cleaner, paint
brush - your choice, but clean around the
covers carefully.
:::

Remove the valve cover fasteners. Four
6mm hex head cap screws around the edges;
two 6mm allen screws down the middle. Pull
off the valve covers. You may need to bump
them gently to initially dislodge, but no prying
or banging please. Note right and left because
they’re different.

### Clean and Regasket

:::info make sure
When replacing the gasket, ensure the valve cover and cylinder head
are completely cleaned before installation of new gaskets.
:::

The A8 valve covers are beautiful
aluminum die castings. The gaskets
themselves are molded neoprene in two
pieces for each bank: one to seal the
spark plug holes, the other to seal the
valve cover gasket edges.


Pull off the old gaskets and discard.
Clean the valve cover gasket surfaces
with turpentine, solvent, or aerosol
brake cleaner. Wipe clean and dry with a
paper towel. Clean the mating cylinder
head surfaces. Aerosol brake cleaner and
a toothbrush work well for this. Be sure
to remove the dried silicone sealer
located at the front and back of each
head. Wipe dry.


Using a “brush in can” gasket sealer
such as Permatex Aviation or Loctite
High Tack, sparingly brush sealer all
around the (rough) edge of each valve
cover. After allowing 5 minutes or so of
set up, fit the new gaskets to each valve
cover. They only go on one way; both
center and edge gaskets.


With the valve covers ready to go back on,
first smear a dab of automotive silicone sealer
at the front and rear sharp edge sealing valleys
of each valve cover. This will fill in any gaps.
Just a very little bit is needed; four places on
each valve cover.

### Reassemble

Put the covers back on making sure all the
hoses and what have you are out of the way,
ensure the cylinder head sealing surfaces are
perfectly clean and dry. Check that the valve
cover screw holes are not full of oil or
solvent.

:::caution Important
Run up the six valve cover screws just finger tight, then gradually work a circle around the six screws 1/2 turn at a time. This will evenly draw down
the cover, uniformly compressing the gaskets. Tighten to about 18 lb-ft of torque.
Reinstall front engine hose, fuel hoses, and coil wire troughs. Blow out the
spark plug wells before fitting the coils. Tighten coil fasteners to about 12 lb-ft of
torque.
:::

Replace engine plastic, then remove paper towels and install breather hose,
lining up index marks and clamping securely.
Drive your A8 for a couple of days to burn off the oil and cleaner that got
slopped around during the procedure. It should then be oil tight and odor free.
